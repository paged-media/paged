// ADR 323 — the migration of a composition panel onto `PropertyField`.
//
// A composition declares its fields as `selectionProperty` bindings on
// type-specific leaves (`paged.input.length`, `.color-swatch`, …): the
// LEAF decides the type. `asPropertyFields(node)` rewrites every such
// field into a `paged.input.property` node naming the same path, so the
// TYPE comes from the target's schema row and reads/writes go through
// `host.objects` — and every field gains "Bind to data…" and the badges.
//
// What it keeps: the label, chrome props (icon, prefix, suffix,
// placeholder, layout) and the presentation of enum-like TEXT paths (the
// options and whether they were segments or a select), and a collection
// select's collection (`collectionName` → `style: "collection"`) — core's schema
// says `text` for those until it publishes their members (ADR 132).
// Literal-bound and seam nodes are left exactly as they were.
//
// Pure, so the node unit test pins it.
