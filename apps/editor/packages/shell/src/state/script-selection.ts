// A selection a SCRIPT makes reaches the shell.
//
// `paged.setElementSelection([...])` / `paged.clearSelection()` move the
// ENGINE's selection inside the worker, and nothing tells the main thread:
// the shell's mirror (the selection box, the control bar, every panel
// bound to the selection) went on showing what was selected before. Every
// script run ends in a `scriptResult` reply, whoever started it (Script
// panel, console, playground, the assistant, a plugin's script bridge),
// and every reply fans out to the client's subscribers, so that is the one
// place to look.
//
// After a run the engine's selection is read back and compared with the
// selection the engine last REPORTED (every `elementSelectionApplied`
// reply names it). Only a script that changed it is followed, the way a
// click is: the selection, then its geometry. Comparing against the
// engine's own last answer rather than the shell's mirror keeps the
// shell's mirror-only selections (a harness, a panel row) out of it, and
// a background read-only script (`paged.stories()` behind the thread
// lines) changes nothing and so updates nothing.
