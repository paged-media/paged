// Place — "where should this go?", asked with the pointer.
//
// THE GAP. `File ▸ Place…` picked an image and dropped it CENTRED on the
// current page. Every place landed in the same spot, so placing four
// images meant placing four images on top of each other and dragging
// three of them off the pile. The plan called this a missing "loaded
// cursor", which mis-described it: Place has no modal state to escape,
// and the cursor is the symptom. The gap is that the user is never
// asked WHERE.
//
// WHY A BARE PROMISE AND NOT A CONTEXT. The threading cursor solves the
// same shape — arm, then let the next click resolve — with a context, a
// provider and a headless controller component, because threading has
// STATE worth sharing: which frame you dragged from, what the ports
// should draw while loaded, what Esc means. Place has none of that. It
// needs one point, once, inside a function that is already async. A
// promise is the whole feature, and a second copy of the threading
// machinery would be more code that can disagree with itself.
//
// THE CURSOR IS SET WITH `!important` ON THE ROOT for the reason
// ThreadingController documents at its own call site: the canvas, the
// panels and the menu bar each set their own cursor, so anything less
// specific loses over most of the window and the copy cursor appears
// only in the gaps.
