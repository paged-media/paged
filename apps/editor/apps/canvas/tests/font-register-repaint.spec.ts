// A page re-laid out by a font registration repaints.
//
// Registering a document face (a plugin's `host.assets.registerDocumentFont`,
// or the client's `registerFont`) makes the engine re-lay the text that
// names that family, and its `fontRegistered` reply lists the pages that
// moved. The worker flagged its render loop for mutations, undo/redo,
// scripts and scene layers, but not for this reply, so the canvas kept
// the old glyphs until the next camera move or edit.
//
// The live canvas is not readable headlessly (no 2D context on the
// OffscreenCanvas), so the repaint is read off the worker's own journal:
// the render loop records a `worker.frame` for every tick that draws, and
// draws only when flagged dirty or when the camera moved.
