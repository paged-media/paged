// PLUGIN MENUS — paged.doc (modules/doc/packages/doc-bundle/src/menu.ts).
//
// One entry: Object ▸ Insert Word document…, which the bar files under
// Insert ▸ Word document….
//
// WHAT EVERY ENTRY OWES, asserted per entry through the real menu bar
// (menu-driver.ts says where an entry shows and how a click is observed):
//
//   · without a document it is GREYED and a click runs nothing (the SDK
//     scopes every plugin entry to "a document is open");
//   · with one it is enabled, and a click runs exactly its command, once,
//     with no payload, and the handler settles without throwing;
//   · what the click then does, where the editor can see it: the panel it
//     raises (`host.shell.openPanel`), the file it asks for
//     (`host.shell.pickFile`, answered "cancelled"), the document it changes
//     (an IDML export digest) and that ONE Undo takes that change back.
//
// What a command does to a richer document than the one set up here is
// the command's own suite (the bundle's unit and headless tests); this file
// is about the menu entry: reachable, gated, wired to its command.
