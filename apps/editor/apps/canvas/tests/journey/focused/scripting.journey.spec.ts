// Journey: the paged.* scripting runtime.
//
// A power user drives the document through the script console — reads the
// scene tree, sets a property (which lands as an undoable Operation),
// inspects it, logs to the console, undoes/redoes, and watches a runaway
// loop get cut off by the runtime budget without taking the worker down.
// Plus the two scripting surfaces (script editor + REPL) mount.
