// The engine catalog, shipped with this package so a consumer does not have
// to install @paged-media/introspect-wasm (11.5 MB of wasm) to read 140 KB of
// JSON. It is plugin-api's vendored copy, which CI holds in lockstep with
// the engine version the wire types were synced from (publish.yml). A
// separate entry point: the editor loads it on the first AI request, not at
// boot.
