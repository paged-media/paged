// The plugin manifest — the serializable identity + contribution
// declaration every bundle ships as `manifest.json`. Mirrors
// `manifest.schema.json` (the CLI validates against the schema; these
// types keep TS authors honest).
//
// API v0 status: the manifest is ENFORCED, not advisory (W3.10 /
// trust-line W0.11). A door a bundle USES must be DECLARED here — the
// host's capability gate (plugin-sdk `createBundleHost`) refuses an
// undeclared use (a thrown `PluginCapabilityError` for the contribution
// + read doors, a non-applied `MutationOutcome` for the write doors).
// v1 stance: in-process, no isolation — this is HONESTY +
// accident-prevention, NOT a security boundary against malicious code
// (a bundle holding the raw `host.editor` handle still bypasses the
// facade). The gate is at the same chokepoint as the namespace rule
// (DESIGN.md §2.7/§11); the host option `capabilityMode: 'warn'` is the
// migration escape hatch. See thoughts/docs/paged/plugin-trust-line.md.
